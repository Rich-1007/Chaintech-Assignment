<p>
  This React project includes a user registration component that collects user data (first name, last name, age, email, phone number, city, state, and country) with form validation, ensuring all fields are filled before submission. It uses Redux for state management and react-hot-toast for notifications. The login page handles user authentication with basic input validation, while the edit profile page allows users to view and update their personal information. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a responsive and modern UI.
